Create an appointment scheduling system for Radiant Nails. Everything is done on paper and there is a dire need
for an online appointment scheduling system to stay organized and track sales

Client Side appointment schedule:

1. Create a safe and authenticated system for clients to book an appointment without creating an account.
2. This includes name, phone, email, and autogenerated password with login using link/phone number.
   This will be done similarly to sign up genius and time2meet which do not use a password to login
3. Due to Radiant Nails' personalization and current appointment system, they would like to check whether
   an appointment can actually fit and these range based on the services.
4. Clients will request which services they want done and the system will decide how much time is needed to fulfill
   the appointment. The system will then give the customer available time slots up to 2 weeks in advance.
5. The client will receive an email/phone notification of their appointment and a link to change/cancel the appointment
   as well as whether it is approved on Radiant Nails' side. The best option is still to call.
6. Radiant Nails has the right to change appointments based on their needs and will send out a message on why (too little time)
7. appointments will be done in increments of 5 min
8. There may be some overlap of time as multiple customers may be served
9. Be able to buy a digital giftcard to use at Radiant Nails

Web design:

1. Have a navigation bar at the top which includes the home page, about, schedule appointment, services, and contact
2. Give some pictures and statistics for the main website
3. Include some reviews taken from yelp/google for others to see
4. Include some FAQ, hours, and etc
5. We need a clean ui that encapsulates everything

Radiant Nails side dashboard:

1. Create a dashboard for Radiant Nails to see their appointments, schedule them
2. They should be able to manually schedule services to put in a dynamic calendar
3. Show the number of appointments booked in the last month, how much money was earned from services/tip
4. Be able to view the entire history for each person and their appointments, and added summaries
5. Unique and authenticated login for admin dashboard
6. most popular treatments

Database Design:
